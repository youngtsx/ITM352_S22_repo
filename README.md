Hi, my name is Tiffany Young 

I'm a sophomore at UH Manoa studying MIS. I often spend my freetime watching youtube, playing piano, and watching anime. This is what I've been doing over the course of the pandemic as well, whenever I'm not working. I work at a sushi restaurant and my favorite food is also sushi, and this fact has held up even as I've been eating sushi consistently for the 2+ years I've worked at this restaurant.
